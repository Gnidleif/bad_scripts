Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
All good things must come to an end
A picture is worth a thousand words
A watched pot never boils
Beggars can't be choosers
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Better late than never
Birds of a feather flock together
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Don't judge a book by its cover
Don't put all of your eggs in one basket
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today
Don't put too many irons in the fire
Easy come, easy go
Fortune favors the bold
God helps those who help themselves
Good things come to those who wait
Honesty is the best policy
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
If you play with fire, you'll get burned
If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer
Knowledge is power
Laughter is the best medicine.
Like father, like son
No man is an island
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Practice makes perfect
The early bird gets the worm
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
The grass is always greener on the other side
The pen is mightier than the sword
There is no place like home
There is no such thing as a free lunch.
There is no time like the present
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Time is money
Two heads are better than one
Two wrongs don't make a right
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
Where there's smoke, there's fire
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink it
You can't always get what you want
